# PSD2Html: Front End Assignment
Create a responsive HTML and CSS one page website using core_guide.jpg as a guide to how it will look like.
Important:

- You may use a font of your liking from google fonts
- Do not change the layout or image sizes.
- All you require is located in the assets folder.

You can get the icons from [iconicons](http://ionicons.com)

This is an assessment of what you learnt during the Html and CSS work.

Work is due on Monday!


All the best!
